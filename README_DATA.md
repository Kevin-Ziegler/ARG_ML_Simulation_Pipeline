There are 13 Compressed Tar folders in this submission. Each folder contains a dataset:

There are the 10 folders for the 10 replicates used in the main paper (Replicate1-10)
1 folder of MDS distance matrices and points: AveragedMDS_DistanceMatrix_Points.tar.gz
1 folder simulating a smaller region 10k:Data10k.tar.gz
1 folder simulating a larger region 200k:Data200k.tar.gz


Within each of the 12 folders representing a simulated dataset, there are 6 directories:

	Relate
		-files used to run Relate and results
	Tsinfer
		--files used to run Tsinfer and results
	RentPlus
